Briefing on Julian DSSange

DSSange is the founder of UniLeaks. To promote his strong
libertarian ideals, he commissioned the creation of the site
to three UEA cybersecurity students, to allow students and 
staff to 'leak' sensitive information about their universities. 
He is fighting a court battle to avoid extradition to the US 
following the leaking of classified UEA documents that revealed
crimes commited against students at US universities. He sought 
refuge living in the UEA library for several years, before 
being thrown out by security for bad behaviour.
